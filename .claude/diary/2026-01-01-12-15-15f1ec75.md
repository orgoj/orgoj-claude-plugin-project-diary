# Session Diary

**Date**: 2026-01-01 12:15
**Session ID**: 15f1ec75-4abc-48c5-b24b-9e1c0b947eb8
**Project**: /home/michael/work/ai/CLAUDE/marketplaces/orgoj-claude-plugin-project-diary
**Git Branch**: master

## Task Summary
User requested improvements to the project-diary plugin: adding "Mistakes & Corrections" and "Lessons Learned" sections to the diary template, and creating a `/bump-version` slash command for version management.

## Work Done
- Added "Mistakes & Corrections" section to `commands/diary.md`
- Added "Lessons Learned" section to `commands/diary.md`
- Created `/bump-version` command in `.claude/commands/bump-version.md`
- Bumped version 1.4.0 → 1.5.0 in `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with v1.5.0 entry
- Updated `README.md` with new diary sections documentation

## Design Decisions
- `/bump-version` placed in `.claude/commands/` (project-local) not `commands/` (plugin distribution) - because it's a dev workflow tool, not part of the distributed plugin
- Version bump type: minor (1.5.0) - because new features were added, not just fixes
- README update scope: document actual feature behavior, not just version numbers

## Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Initially created bump-version in wrong directory | User corrected, moved to `.claude/commands/` |
| Used wrong skill (skill-creator instead of working-with-claude-code) | User pointed out to check skill descriptions |
| README update was incomplete (only version, not features) | User corrected - README must reflect actual app state |

## Mistakes & Corrections

### Where I Made Errors:
- Used `handbook:skill-creator` skill for creating slash commands - wrong skill type
- Created `/bump-version` in `commands/` (plugin distribution) instead of `.claude/commands/` (project-local)
- Initially only updated README version references, not feature documentation
- Did not check skill descriptions carefully before invoking

### What Caused the Mistakes:
- Assumption that "skill-creator" handles all command/skill creation
- Confusion between plugin commands (distributed) vs project commands (local dev tools)
- Narrow interpretation of "update README" as version numbers only

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons:
- Plugin `commands/` = distributed with plugin, available to users
- Project `.claude/commands/` = local dev workflow, not distributed
- `superpowers-developing-for-claude-code:working-with-claude-code` skill has reference docs for slash commands

### Process Lessons:
- Read skill descriptions carefully before invoking - match to actual task
- When creating dev tools, consider if they belong in plugin or project
- README updates must cover feature changes, not just version numbers

### To Remember for CLAUDE.md:
- Check skill descriptions before invoking
- Distinguish plugin distribution files from project-local dev tools

## User Preferences Observed

### Git & PR Preferences:
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`
- Include version in commit message for version bumps

### Code Quality Preferences:
- Czech language for communication
- Direct, no-nonsense feedback style
- Expects immediate correction when pointed out

### Technical Preferences:
- Keep plugin commands separate from dev workflow commands
- README must accurately document current application state

## Code Patterns Used
- Slash command with frontmatter: `description`, `allowed-tools`, `argument-hint`
- Bash context injection in commands: `!`backtick syntax
- Version stored in both `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`

## Notes
- User opened `marketplace.json` in IDE during session (may have been verifying changes)
- Plugin uses semantic versioning
- No git tags exist yet for this project
